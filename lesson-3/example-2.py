# Convert the lyrics into string:

# When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
# Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
# And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me
# Speaking words of wisdom, let it be
# Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
# Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

# Each line should be assigned to its own variable! 
# Look for patterns and use different string operators

# Example:
# + - concatenation (adding two strings together)
# * - generate multiple copies of the string

be = "let it be"
wisdom = "words of wisdom"

line_1 = "When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me"

line_2 = "Speaking " + wisdom + ', ' + be

line_3 = "And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me"

line_4 = line_2

line_5 = be * 4


# Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

line_6 = "Whisper " + wisdom + ", " + be
