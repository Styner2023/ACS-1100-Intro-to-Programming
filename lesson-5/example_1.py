# This is a boolean expression "is 5 < 6?" will evaluate and 
# then the resulting boolean data type will be stored in result 

# result = 5 < 6

# what will we see when we print result?
# print(result)
# Check the type of the result
# print(type(result))

# What data type is result? 

# Numerical values can be compared for equality 
# The values are being checked, not the data type
# print(10 == 10.0)

# But for strings, this doesnt work. 
# print("10" == 10)


# try writing 3 more boolean expressions on your own and we will share
